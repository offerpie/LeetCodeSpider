 * 
 * 
 * 
 * In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word another.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * You need to output the sentence after the replacement.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
 * sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
 * Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The input will only have lower-case letters.
 *  1 <= dict words number <= 1000 
 *  1 <= sentence words number <= 1000  
 *  1 <= root length <= 100 
 *  1 <= sentence words length <= 1000

 * [648] 单词替换
 * 
 * 
 * 在英语中，我们有一个叫做 词根(root)的概念，它可以跟着其他一些词组成另一个较长的单词——我们称这个词为 继承词(successor)。例如，词根an，跟随着单词 other(其他)，可以形成新的单词 another(另一个)。
 * 
 * 现在，给定一个由许多词根组成的词典和一个句子。你需要将句子中的所有继承词用词根替换掉。如果继承词有许多可以形成它的词根，则用最短的词根替换它。
 * 
 * 你需要输出替换之后的句子。
 * 
 * 示例 1:
 * 
 * 输入: dict(词典) = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
 * sentence(句子) = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
 * 输出: "the cat was rat by the bat"
 * 
 * 
 * 注:
 * 
 * 
 * 	输入只包含小写字母。
 * 	1 <= 字典单词数 <=1000
 * 	1 <=  句中词语数 <= 1000
 * 	1 <= 词根长度 <= 100
 * 	1 <= 句中词语长度 <= 1000
