/**
 * [791] Custom Sort String
 * 
 * difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * TestCase Example: "cba" "abcd"
 * 
 * https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/custom-sort-string/
 * 
 * 
 * S and T are strings composed of lowercase letters. In S, no letter occurs more than once.
 * 
 * S was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of T so that they match the order that S was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in S, then x should occur before y in the returned string.
 * 
 * Return any permutation of T (as a string) that satisfies this property.
 * 
 * 
 * Example :
 * Input: 
 * S = "cba"
 * T = "abcd"
 * Output: "cbad"
 * Explanation: 
 * "a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
 * Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
 * 
 * 
 *  
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 	S has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in S.
 * 	T has length at most 200.
 * 	S and T consist of lowercase letters only.

 * [791] 自定义字符串排序
 * 
 * 
 * 字符串S和 T 只包含小写字符。在S中，所有字符只会出现一次。
 * 
 * S 已经根据某种规则进行了排序。我们要根据S中的字符顺序对T进行排序。更具体地说，如果S中x在y之前出现，那么返回的字符串中x也应出现在y之前。
 * 
 * 返回任意一种符合条件的字符串T。
 * 
 * 示例:
 * 输入:
 * S = "cba"
 * T = "abcd"
 * 输出: "cbad"
 * 解释: 
 * S中出现了字符 "a", "b", "c", 所以 "a", "b", "c" 的顺序应该是 "c", "b", "a". 
 * 由于 "d" 没有在S中出现, 它可以放在T的任意位置. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" 都是合法的输出。
 * 
 * 
 * 注意:
 * 
 * 
 * 	S的最大长度为26，其中没有重复的字符。
 * 	T的最大长度为200。
 * 	S和T只包含小写字符。
